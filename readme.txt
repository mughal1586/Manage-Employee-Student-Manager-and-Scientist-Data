CPP Program to Store and Display Employee, Student, Manager, and Scientist Data

Description
This C++ program demonstrates the use of classes to store and display data for different categories: Employee, Student, Manager, and Scientist. It takes input for each category and then displays the entered information.

Features
-   Uses classes to represent Employee, Student, Manager, and Scientist.
-   Takes user input to gather details for each category.
-   Displays the entered data in a formatted manner.

Code Structure
The code consists of the following classes and files:
-   `Employee`: Defines the structure and functions for Employee data (id, name).
-   `Student`: Defines the structure and functions for Student data (school, degree).
-   `Manager`: Defines the structure and functions for Manager data (title, dues).
-   `Scientist`: Defines the structure and functions for Scientist data (publications).
-   `main.cpp`:  Contains the main function that uses these classes to get and display data.

Dependencies
-   iostream: For input/output operations.
-   string: For using string data type.

Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the program, save the files with their respective .cpp and .h extensions (e.g., Employee.cpp, Employee.h, etc.) and use a C++ compiler.
